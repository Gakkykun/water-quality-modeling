    "# Streeter Phelps Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "A pioneering work by Streeter and Phelps {cite}`phelps1958study` characterized basic reaction kinetics in Ohio River. Here are assumptions of the Streeter-Phelps model:\n",
    "- Constant depth ($z$) and Width ($w$)\n",
    "- Constant cross-sectional area ($A=z\\times w$)\n",
    "- Constant horizontal flow velocity ($u$)\n",
    "- Uniform concentrations of BOD and DO at a segment (control volume) of river\n",
    "- Concurrent occurrence of purification of BOD and consumption of DO\n",
    "\n",
    "We construct governing equations for BOD and DO based on mass balance. Before that, let's consider a flux, $J$. Flux represents a transfer rate per unit area. In the mass balance equation, we need to multiply $J$ by a cross-sectional area, $A$. In the left-hand side, an accumulation term is placed, while in the right-hand side, input, output and reaction terms are placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(Adx)\\frac{dC}{dt} = A(J\\vert_x - J\\vert_{x+dx}) + (Adx)R\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streeter-Phelps model considers a first-order purification by aerobic microorganisms as degradation of BOD is described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R = \\frac{dC_{BOD}}{dt} = -k_B C_{BOD}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_B$ is a first-order reaction rate constant. This is incorporated into the mass balance equation of BOD. We replace $J$ with $C_{BOD}(u)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(Adx)\\frac{\\ C_{BOD}}{\\partial t} = C_{BOD}\\vert_x (uA) - C_{BOD}\\vert_{x+dx}(uA) - k_B C_{BOD} (Adx)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Taylor expansion, we can replace $C_{BOD}\\vert_{x+dx}$  with $C_{BOD}\\vert_x + \\frac{dC_{BOD}}{dx}dx$. Also, we consider a steady-state condition: $\\frac{\\partial C_{BOD}}{\\partial t} = 0$ so that the right-hand side becomes 0. After rearranging the equation, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u\\frac{dC_{BOD}}{dx} + k_BC_{BOD} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",

    "An analytical solution of the differential equation for BOD is given by:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "C_{BOD} = C_{BOD_0}exp(-\\frac{k_B}{u}x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we set a boundary condition at $x=0$: $C_{BOD} = C_{BOD_0}$.\n",

    "  \\end{split}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{D_m}{\\delta}$ is replaced with $k_a$, which is called mass transfer coefficient. Please keep in mind that we need to multiply the flux of oxygen dissolution by $wdx$, which corresponds to the surface faced with atmosphere. Mass Balance of DO is constructed as the following:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "C_{DO}\\vert_x (uA) - C_{DO}\\vert_{x+dx}(uA) + k_a(wdx)(C_{DO}^* - C_{DO}) - k_B BOD (Adx) = (Adx)\\frac{\\ C_{DO}}{\\partial t}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$k_a^*$ is called re-aeration coefficient and is calculated by $\\frac{k_a}{z}$. Finally, An analytical solution of the differential equation for BOD is given by:\n",

On the other hand, the flow rate of wastewater and BOD and DO concentrations are $5 \\times 10^4\\:m^3/d$, $200\\:g/m^3$ and $0\\:g/m^3$, respectively.
