    "# IWA River Water Quality Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "The river water quality model no.1 (RWQM1) was developed to facilitate practical application of river water quality modeling {cite}`reichert2001river`. It offers a suitable description of nutrient and community dynamics and represents flows of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus through an aquatic “food web” {cite}`broekhuizen2012modification`. The followings are assumptions of this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The elemental composition (e.g., C, H, O, N, and P) of all compounds and organisms is constant.\n",
    "- The stoichiometry of all processes is constant.\n",
    "- No adaptation of specific organisms takes place.\n",
    "- Changes in the composition within organism classes are neglected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are a number of biological and chemical water quality transformation processes occurring in real nature, identification of main processes is an important step in the modeling. Kinetics and stoichiometry relevant to those processes are incorporated into mass balance equations: \n",

    "where $r_i$ is a reaction rate, $\\nu_{i,j}$ is a stoichiometry, and $\\rho_j$ is a process rate. The IWA model deals with dissolved (denoted as $S$) and particulate (denoted as $X$) materials as shown below.\n",

    "Before looking at the IWA model, let's first consider the very simple system in which there are just three components: bacteria, substrate and dissolved oxygen. Process kinetics and stoichiometry for heterotrophic bacterial growth and decay in an aerobic environment are summarized in a matrix form. The column represents the three components, whereas the row does processes involved in this sytem, which are growth and decay. There is an additional column for process rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this matrix, we can mechanistically construct reaction rates for each component, simply multiplying a stoichiometry by a process rate in the same row and sum them in the column direction. Reaction rates for bacteria biomass ($X_B$), soluble substrate($S_s$), dissolved oxygen($S_o$) are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "For biomass:\n",
    "\n",

    "Now, let's move on to how bacteria population is formulated, which is referred to as Monod kinetics. A specific growth rate, which has a unit of $\\frac{1}{d}$, represents a ratio of biomass variation ($\\frac{dX}{dt}$) to the biomass ($X$):\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "When a substrate concentration is much larger than $K_S$, a specific growth rate does not vary as the substrate concentration increases and it is zero-order, while it is first order when the substrate concentration is much smaller than $K_S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw the inhibitory effect of substrate on growth above, but there are other inhibitory effects to be considered, which are temperature and light intensity (only considered for $X_{ALG}$ in the model). \n",
    "\n",
    "Process rates covered in the IWA model have a common components, which are a rate constant, a temperature correction ($e^{\\beta (T - T_0)}$), Monod-type fomulas ($\\frac{S}{K + S}$),  and particulate concentration ($X$). Light intensity effect ($\\frac{I}{K_I}exp(1 - \\frac{I}{K_I})$) is only considered for algae. For Monod-type formulas, when a concentration is very low, a switching function is used: $\\frac{K}{K+S}$, thereby this term is going to be nearly 1 to avoid making the process rate zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Form the perspectives of substrate decomposition, we introduce a yield coefficient, which is a sort of conversion factor, indicating the increase in biomass with a unit of mg per 1 mg of substrate. The value is typically in the range of 0.4 to 0.8 for aerobic heterotophic bacteria. \n",

There are three mixing points (named Jugo, Kyugo, and Chubu) to be considered in this simulation as shown in Table. At each mixing point, we update values of a concentration, a flow velocity, and the number of reservoirs in the downstream. Concentrations after mixing are used as the new initial conditions. In between Chubu and Kuki, wastewater is directly discharged from households into the river. Those nonpoint sources are introduced as constant model inputs for each segment. Concentrations of water quality parameters such as BOD, DO, $NH_4$, $NO_2$+$NO_3$ are monitored monthly at Chubu and Kuki.\n",
