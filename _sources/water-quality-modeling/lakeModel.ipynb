    "In this section, we will see vertical one-dimentional ecological model, in which advection and dispersion differential equations are applied. Advection and dispersion terms included in all of mass balance equations for water quality items of interest are summarized as $F(X)$, where $X$ is a water quality item. Let's see how each term of $F(X)$ is derived. Symbols that appear in equations are listed in tables. For advections in the horizontal and vertical directions, we describe them as:\n",
