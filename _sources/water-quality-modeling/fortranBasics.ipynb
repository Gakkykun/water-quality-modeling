    "In Fortran, you need to first declare a type of variable. The types for number typically used are real (a number with a decimal point) and integer (a number without a decimal point). We want to set double precision for real to conduct more accurate calculations. We can use a module, iso_fortran_env and add (real64) to real as shown below.\n",

    "We cover five important features of Fortran in this section, showing examples of how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input and output\n",
    "Let's think of a simple input and output operation: After asked \"Enter the number: \" in the terminal, we want to type an arbitrary number (which must be integer for this case) and store that number to a variable named $\\verb|num|$ and then to show that number in the terminal with a message of \"number = \". We declare the type of $\\verb|num|$ as integer in the first line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Fortran\n",
    " integer :: num \n",
    "\n",
    " print*, 'Enter the number: '\n",
    " read*, num\n",
    " print*, 'number = ', num   \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next example, we want to control a format of how numbers are displayed in the terminal. Instead of using $\\verb|*|$ after $\\verb|print|$, we can use $\\verb|'(*F10.4))'|$. Here $\\verb|F|$ indicates \"floating number\", $\\verb|10|$ means that we secure $10$ digits including blanks, while $\\verb|4|$ is to set a number of decimal places. By placing $\\verb|*|$ in front of $\\verb|F|$, we do not have to manually indicate the number of variables (i.e., three in this case). We need to put 'd0' after a number to 'activate' the double precision. If we forget to add it, the value remains single precision, even though we declare the type in the double precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Fortran\n",
    "real(real64) :: a, b, c \n",
    "\n",
    " a=1.9d0; b=2.4d0; c=3.3d0\n",
    " print '(*F10.4))' a, b, c\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's slightly modify the previous code. We want to write numbers of a to c to a $\\verb|csv|$ file. We need to use a $\\verb|open|$ function, which requires two arguments $\\verb|unit|$ and $\\verb|file|$. The former is a number allocated to a different file to be differentiated from other files, while the latter is a file name ($\\verb|results.csv|$ in this case). Next, we need to use a $\\verb|write|$ function. Again, we will provide two arguments. The first is exactly same with the $\\verb|open|$ function. We can omit $\\verb|unit=|$. The second is a format as previously seen. Format is always defined with single quotes. $\\verb|*|$ indicates repeat of a format, $\\verb|(g0:, \",\")|$ as long as data (a to c for this case) exist. Since we deal with a $\\verb|csv|$ file, we provide $\\verb|\",\"|$ in the second position as a delimiter, while $\\verb|g0:|$ in the first position indicates automatic adjustment of displaying and not giving a comma ($\\verb|,|$) after the last number (i.e., $\\verb|c|$).\n",
